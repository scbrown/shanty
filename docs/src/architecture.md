## Design principles

### Single binary

Shanty is a single Go binary with no runtime dependencies beyond tmux itself. The binary serves two roles:

1. **Session manager** — creates, attaches to, and lists tmux sessions
2. **Segment renderer** — tmux calls `shanty seg <name>` to render status bar segments

### Config generation

Rather than shipping a static tmux config, shanty generates one on each launch. This allows the config to incorporate the current theme, keybindings, and segment list dynamically.

The generated config is written to `~/.config/shanty/tmux.conf`. When attaching to an existing session, shanty regenerates and sources the config so changes take effect immediately.

### Socket isolation

Shanty uses a dedicated tmux socket (`-L shanty`). This means:

- Shanty gets its own tmux server with its own config
- It won't interfere with other tmux servers on the default socket
- The `-f` flag for config is respected (tmux ignores `-f` if a server is already running on the same socket)

### Segment interface

All segments implement a simple interface:

```go
type Segment interface {
    Name() string
    Render() string
}
```

Segments are registered in a global `Registry` map. The `seg` subcommand looks up the segment by name and calls `Render()`.

### Caching

Segments that call external commands (e.g., the shantytown segments) share a cache with a 15-second TTL. The cache lives **on disk**, not in memory: every `#(shanty seg …)` is its own short-lived process, so a process-local cache is never hit twice and each render paid full price. Only successful answers are cached — pinning a failure for the whole TTL would make the segments' visible error states lag reality.
