# Install via a temp file and a rename, NOT a plain cp.
#
# cp writes THROUGH to the existing inode, and the kernel refuses that for a
# binary that is currently executing: "cp: cannot create regular file ...: Text
# file busy". On any host actually using shanty that is the normal state, not an
# edge case — the status bar re-runs `shanty seg` every few seconds in every
# pane, so `make install` fails precisely when shanty is in use.
#
# A rename swaps the directory entry instead. Already-running processes keep the
# old inode until they exit, and the next exec gets the new binary.
