//
// Two things about the shape of this line are load-bearing.
//
// The popup runs shanty by ABSOLUTE path, for the same reason the status
// segments do (see selfPath): tmux runs it from the SERVER's environment, whose
// PATH need not contain ~/.local/bin. A bare name here would make prefix+s do
// nothing at all on exactly the hosts where it is hardest to debug.
//
// And the whole thing is guarded by if-shell rather than by deciding at
// generation time whether fzf exists. The config is regenerated on attach but
// SOURCED into a long-lived server, so a generation-time decision freezes the
// answer from whichever moment shanty last ran. The if-shell asks when the key
// is pressed, so installing fzf takes effect without regenerating anything, and
// a host without it keeps working prefix+s — the stock tree — instead of a key
// that silently does nothing.
