// that want you to act — who this is and what state they are in, what they hold,
// what is waiting on them, then what they have actually been doing. CPU, memory,
// host and clock are ambient and sit furthest out.
//
// They are included unconditionally, which is safe and deliberate. Every one
// self-hides when no `st` binary exists at all, so a user who does not run
// shantytown sees exactly the old bar and pays one exec per segment per interval
// to learn nothing changed. The alternative — probing for `st` here and building a
// different default — would make the bar's contents depend on installation order,
// which is worse than a cheap no-op.
