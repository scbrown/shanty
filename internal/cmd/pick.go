	Short: "Fuzzy-switch sessions, most recently used first",
	Long: `Switch sessions from a fuzzy-filtering list. Type to narrow it; Enter picks.

This is what prefix+s runs. The list is ordered by when you were last IN each
session, with the session you just switched away from at the top — so prefix+s
then Enter is a toggle back. The session you are currently in is not offered.

It is meant to be run inside a tmux popup, where $TMUX identifies both the server
and the client to switch; the generated shanty config binds it that way. Run by
hand with --list to see the ordering without switching anything.

Requires fzf. Without it, prefix+s falls back to tmux's own choose-tree.`,
