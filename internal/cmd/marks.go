The marks are what make a wall of panes readable without reading: one glance at
the bar identifies the agent. They are assigned on first sight and NEVER
reassigned, because a mark that moves when the roster changes destroys the
recognition it exists to provide.

The registry is a plain TOML file — the path is printed below. To choose your own
mark for an agent, edit its line; assignment will not overwrite it. Keep them
distinct, or two panes will look like the same agent.

Crew that st knows about but which have no mark yet are assigned one here.`,
