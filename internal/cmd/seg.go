var segCmd = &cobra.Command{
	Use:   "seg <name>",
	Short: "Render a status bar segment",
	Long: `Render a single status bar segment for tmux.

tmux calls this via #(shanty seg <name> [session]) at status-interval.
Each segment outputs a short formatted string with optional tmux color codes.

System segments: clock, host, cpu, mem, load, disk

shantytown segments, which read the st CLI:
  crewid   who this pane is — mark, name, role, and st's busy/idle verdict
  task     what they hold — item id and title
  stats    what they did — activity, files touched, token traffic
  crew     the fleet's busy/total count
  events   undelivered stop events addressed to this agent
  inbox    unread messages
  harness  the agent runtime's name
  anchor   the held item's id alone (superseded by task)

Identity comes from $SHANTY_AGENT, else from the session name passed as the
second argument (shanty-<agent> or st-<agent>). tmux runs status commands from
the SERVER's environment, not the pane's, so on a fleet the session name is
normally what identifies the pane — pass #{session_name}.

Failure is VISIBLE. A segment renders empty only when no st binary exists at
all, so a host without shantytown sees the plain bar. When st IS present and
cannot answer — no identity derivable, a failing call, or a plate st will not
name for an agent it calls busy — the segment renders a ⚠ marker instead. A
status bar that blanks when it breaks reads as "nothing to report".

Environment:
  SHANTY_ST_BIN   the st binary to use (default: PATH, then ~/.local/bin etc.)
  SHANTY_ST_CWD   the directory to run st from. st resolves its tracker by
                  walking up from here, so this decides which store it reads.
  SHANTY_SEG_NOCACHE  disable the shared on-disk answer cache.
