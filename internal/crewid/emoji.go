// Package crewid assigns each crew member one memorable emoji and remembers it.
//
// The point is a WALL of panes. An operator with a dozen agents open should be
// able to tell whose pane they are looking at without reading text, and the mark
// has to mean the same thing tomorrow as it did today.
//
// So the assignment is STORED, not computed. A hash of the agent's name would be
// deterministic per name but its COLLISIONS are not stable: two agents that hash
// to the same emoji have to be broken apart somehow, and every scheme for doing
// that shifts marks around when the roster changes. Adding one crew member would
// silently re-badge others, which destroys exactly the recognition the mark
// exists to provide. A stored registry assigns once, on first sight, and never
// reassigns.
//
// The registry lives beside shanty's other config as TOML. It is shanty's own
// display state — no crew state is touched by reading or writing it.
