// Package stread is shanty's ONE reader for shantytown's `st` CLI.
//
// Why a package and not another exec.Command in each caller: the status bar, the
// session picker, and anything added later must agree about three things that are
// easy to get quietly wrong.
//
//  1. WHERE `st` IS. tmux runs `#(...)` status commands from the SERVER's
//     environment, not the pane's. A tmux server started outside a login shell
//     routinely has a narrower PATH than the user does — no ~/.local/bin — so
//     exec.LookPath("st") fails and every st-backed segment renders empty while
//     `st` works perfectly in every pane. That failure looks exactly like "you do
//     not run shantytown", which is why it can sit undetected for weeks. Bin()
//     therefore looks past PATH into the conventional install directories.
//
//  2. WHERE `st` IS RUN FROM. st resolves its tracker store by walking up from
//     the working directory. The tmux server's cwd is wherever the server was
//     started, which need not be the deployment's tracker root — and st answers a
//     lookup it cannot resolve with EMPTY and exit 0, so the bar renders blank
//     rather than failing. $SHANTY_ST_CWD names the directory to run st from.
//     It is host configuration on purpose: a tracker location must never be
//     compiled into this source.
//
//  3. HOW OFTEN. Every `#(shanty seg X)` is a separate short-lived process, so a
//     process-local cache saves nothing — each render paid full price. st costs
//     ~0.5s per call and the bar polls every few seconds across several segments,
//     which is enough to keep a core busy doing nothing. The cache here is on
//     disk and therefore shared by every segment process.
//
// Errors are returned, never swallowed. Callers decide between hiding (st is not
// installed — a machine without shantytown must see the plain bar) and rendering
// LOUD (st is installed and could not answer). A segment that cannot tell those
// apart renders a convincing blank, which is the failure mode this package exists
// to prevent.
